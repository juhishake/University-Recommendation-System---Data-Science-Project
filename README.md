# University-Recommendation-System---Data-Science-Project
For an aspiring student who wants to apply for higher studies in other countries, university
selection process is a challenging task. Lot of different criteria need to considered during
application process based on individualâ€™s requirement. This problem can be addressed by
modeling a recommender system based on various classification algorithms. In this project based
on the Graduate and Undergraduate student dataset and user profile, a list of 10 best universities
will be suggested such that it maximizes the chances of a student getting admission into those
universities.
